## The Gates of Shell‚Äù, by @spencerhcheng, featuring @julienbarbier42

#### issues:

- _strdup function is needed.
- when exit with CTRL_D there should be a new line.
- commands are running without parameters for now.
- There is lot of memory leaks in this shell.
- _realloc function is needed.


#### TODO
- impelemnt:
	- eval.c `exec file commands`
	- builtins.c `run built in commnads`
	- prompt error message if the command is not built-in or execuatable
