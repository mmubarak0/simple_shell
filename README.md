# 0x16. C - Simple Shell
## The Gates of Shell‚Äù, by @spencerhcheng, featuring @julienbarbier42

#### issues:

- convert getline to our own _getline.
- _strdup function is needed.
- when exit with CTRL_D there should be a new line.
- Commands run only if there is a trailing space in the input.
- commands are running without parameters for now.
- There is lot of memory leaks in this shell.

#### TODO
- impelemnt:
	- eval.c `exec file commands`
	- builtins.c `run built in commnads`
